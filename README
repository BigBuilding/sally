NAME

    sally -- a tool for embedding strings in vector spaces

SYNOPSIS

    sally [-hvV] *config* *input* *output*

DESCRIPTION

    sally is a small tool for mapping a set of strings to a set of vectors.
    This mapping is referred to as embedding and allows for applying
    techniques of machine learning and data mining for analysis of string
    data. sally can applied to several types of string data, such as text
    documents, DNA sequences or log files, where it can handle common
    formats such as directories, archives and text files of string data.

    The embedding is carried out incrementally, where sally first loads a
    chunk of strings from *input*, computes the mapping to vectors and then
    writes the chunk of vectors to *output*. The configuration of this
    process, such as the input format, the embedding type and the output
    format, are specified in the file *config*.

  Embedding strings

    sally implements a standard technique for mapping strings to a vector
    space that is often referred to as vector space model or bag-of-words
    model. The strings are characterized by a set of features, where each
    feature is associated with one dimension of the vector space. The
    following types of features are supported by sally: bytes, words,
    n-grams of bytes and n-grams of words.

    sally proceeds by counting the occurrences of the specified features in
    each string and generating a sparse vector of count values.
    Alternatively, binary or TF-IDF values can be computed and stored in the
    vectors. sally then normalizes the vector, for example using the L1 or
    L2 norm, and outputs it in a specified format, such as plain text or in
    LibSVM or Matlab format.

  Input formats

    Following is a list of input formats supported by sally. See the
    configuration section for more details.

    dir           The input strings are available as binary files in a
                  directory and the name of the directory is given as
                  *input* to sally. The suffixes of the files are used as
                  labels for the extracted vectors.

    arc           The input strings are available as binary files in a
                  compressed archive, such as a zip or tgz archive. The name
                  of the archive is given as *input* to sally. The suffixes
                  of the files are used as labels for the extracted vectors.

    lines         The input strings are available as lines in a text file.
                  The name of the file is given as *input* to sally. No
                  label information is supported by this input format. The
                  lines need to be seperated by newline and may not contain
                  the NUL character.

    fasta         The input strings are available in FASTA format. The name
                  of the file is given as *input* to sally. Labels are
                  extracted from the description of each sequence using a
                  regular expression. Comments are allowed if they are
                  preceeded by either ';' or '>'.

  Feature Sets

    Following is a list of features supported by sally. See the
    configuration section for more details.

    words         The strings are partitioned into substrings (words) using
                  a set of delimiter characters. Such partitioning is
                  typical for natural language processing, where the
                  delimiters are usually defined as whitespace and
                  punctation symbols. An embedding using words is selected
                  by defining a set of delimiter characters and setting the
                  n-gram length to 1. See the configuration section.

    byte n-grams  The strings are characterized by all possible byte
                  sequences of a fixed length n (byte n-grams). These
                  features are frequently used if no information about the
                  structure of strings is available, such as in
                  bioinformatics or computer security. An embedding using
                  byte n-grams is selected by defining the n-gram length and
                  setting the delimiters to an empty string. See the
                  configuration section.

    word n-grams  The strings are characterized by all possible word
                  sequences of a fixed length n (word n-grams). These
                  features require the definition of a set of delimiters and
                  a length n. They are often used in natural language
                  processing as a coarse way for capturing structure of
                  text. An embedding using word n-grams is selected by
                  defining a set of delimiter characters and choosing an
                  n-gram length. See the configuration section.

  Output formats

    Following is a list of output formats supported by sally. See the
    configuration section for more details.

    libsvm        The feature vectors of the embedded strings are stored in
                  libsvm format. The name of the output file is given as
                  *output* to sally.

    text          The feature vectors of the embedded strings are stored as
                  a plain text using a list of dimensions, features and
                  respective values. The name of the output file is given as
                  *output* to sally.

    matlab        The feature vectors of the embedded strings are stored in
                  matlab format (v5). The vectors are stored as a cell array
                  with 2 x n dimensions, where the first row holds the
                  source of each vector and the second the vector itself as
                  a sparse array. The name of the output file is given as
                  *output* to sally.
