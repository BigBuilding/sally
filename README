NAME

    sally -- a tool for embedding strings in vector spaces

SYNOPSIS

    sally [-hvV] *config* *input* *output*

DESCRIPTION

    sally is a small tool for mapping a set of strings to a set of vectors.
    This mapping is referred to as embedding and allows for applying
    techniques from statistics, machine learning and data mining for
    analysis of string data. This is the very intention of sally.

    The embedding is carried out incrementally, where sally first loads a
    chunk of strings from *input*, computes the mapping to vectors and then
    writes the chunk of vectors to *output*. The configuration of this
    process, such as the input format, the embedding type and the output
    format, are specified in the file *config*.

  Embedding strings

    sally implements a standard technique for mapping strings to a vector
    space, which is often referred to as *vector space model* or
    *bag-of-words model*. The strings are characterized by a set of
    features, where each feature is associated with one dimension of the
    resulting vector space. sally supports the following types of features:

    words           The strings are partitioned into substrings (words)
                    using a set of delimiter characters. Such partitioning
                    is typical for natural language processing, where the
                    delimiters are usually defined as whitespace and
                    punctation symbols.

    byte n-grams    The strings are characterized by all possible byte
                    sequences of a fixed length n (byte n-grams). These
                    features are frequently used if no information about the
                    structure of strings is available, such as in
                    bioinformatics or computer security.

    word n-grams    The strings are characterized by all possible word
                    sequences of a fixed length n (word n-grams). These
                    features require the definition of a set of delimiters
                    and a length n. They are often used in natural language
                    processing as a coarse way for capturing structure of
                    text.

    Sally proceeds by counting the occurences of these features in each
    string and generating a vector of count values. Notice that the vector
    is always sparse, as only a limited number of features can be present in
    a given string and hence the vast majority of dimensions is zero and
    does not need to be stored. Sally then normalizes the vector and outputs
    it in the specified format, such as LibSVM or Matlab data files.

    A detailed introduction to the embedding of strings is provided by Rieck
    & Laskov, "Linear-time computation of similarity measures for sequential
    data", Journal of Machine Learning Research, 2008.

  Input formats

    dir             The input strings are available as binary files in a
                    directory and the name of the directory is given as
                    *input* to sally. The suffixes of the files are used as
                    labels for the extracted vectors.

    arc             The input strings are available as binary files in a
                    compressed archive, such as a zip or tgz archive. The
                    name of the archive is given as *input* to sally. The
                    suffixes of the files are used as labels for the
                    extracted vectors.

    lines           The input strings are available as lines in a text file.
                    The name of the file is given as *input* to sally. No
                    label information is supported by this input format. The
                    lines need to be seperated by newline and may not
                    contain the NUL character.

  Output formats

    libsvm          The feature vectors of the embedded strings are stored
                    in libsvm format. The name of the output file is given
                    as *output* to sally.

    text            The feature vectors of the embedded strings are stored
                    as a plain text using a list of dimensions, features and
                    respective values. The name of the output file is given
                    as *output* to sally.

    matlab          The feature vectors of the embedded strings are stored
                    in matlab format (v5). The vectors are stored as a cell
                    array with 2 x n dimensions, where the first row holds
                    the source of each vector and the second the vector
                    itself as a sparse array. The name of the output file is
                    given as *output* to sally.
